# Personal vim config

Remaps the bpéo layout to use vim properly. Contrary to most other setup I’ve seen on bepo.fr, I am fully remaping the keyboard so that it is strictly qwerty on normal/visual mode. I prefer it like that.

The only exception is the y[qwerty] key. The deadkey that is there is a pain and I mapped it to ê[bépo] instead (since it is the additional ISO key that is not there in ANSI anyway).
